# Getting Started

Our guides were designed to help you get familiar with some key concepts, offering a quick and simple approach, so you can get integrated without any friction into our Biometric Engine.

To make things easier, we organized this guides by technological stack. Therefore, to get started, choose one of our client SDKs below: ;-)

## Available Client SDKs

- [SDK Android](guias/android/overview);
- [SDK iOS](guias/iOS/overview);
- [SDK Web](guias/web/overview);
- [SDK Flutter](guias/flutter/overview);

## Guide Structure

Dentro da documentação de cada SDK você encontrará guias para implementar nossas principais funcionalidades, além do API Reference para cada SDK.

In each one of the guides, you will find detailed steps to implement our main features, as well as the References for each SDK;
