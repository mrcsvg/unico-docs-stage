## About us

**Unico Check 3.0** is the best and most complete solution for facial biometric authentication on the market. We relentlessly pursue zero fraud and a fast, fluid customer experience. All this based on a relationship of trust, credibility and accuracy for companies looking for an effective solution to Face-detection frauds and an improvements in their customer journeys.

**Unico Check 3.0** identifies and validates the user with high accuracy, both in their first contact with the Authentication Score and in other recurring transactions with the Biometric Token, all this protection powered by SmartLive, our high-performance proof-of-life detection functionality.

## What we offer

Through a service platform, you can configure its features according to your company's strategic needs.

- **Authentication Score (1:N analysis)**: it is an intelligent method of identifying people in which we evaluate with high efficiency, the probability of one individual being authentic or not. From the selfie with an id number (CPF) and through our biometric engine, the decision is made according to the level of knowledge we have about that face, having also in consideration the information received from the largest private biometric database in Brazil.
- **SmartLive**: SmartLive with interaction is our state-of-the-art proof-of-life feature. A smooth movement of approach when taking a selfie is enough to check safely and assertively whether or not the person is live at the time of taking the selfie.
- **Biometric Token**: It is the functionality aimed at carrying out authentication of people's identity via facial biometrics within an existing registration in the customer's own base, done in less than 1 second.
- **Document analysis**: Our Artificial Intelligence technologies perform the comparison of the informed id number (CPF) and the selfie sent with the documents photographed and attached to the device. At this stage, we also extract data from documents such as CPF, RG and CRM.
- **CPF Match**: Compares the CPF entered with the CPF in the document.
- **Facematch**: Compares the uploaded selfie with the document photo.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Extraction and conversion of document data (RG, CNH and CRM) into text automatically.


## What will you find here

In this space, you will find everything you need to complete the integration in your client, whether Web or Mobile, through our Client SDKs.

:::info API Reference de nosso backend
We will not discuss concepts about our biometric engine APIs here. For information about our APIs, please consult [this page](https://www3.acesso.io/identity/services/v3/docs/).

You can get started quickly through our [integration guides](primeiros-passos#escolha-um-de-nossos-sdks) or our [sample projects](recursos-adicionais/exemplos). We also provide API References for each of our SDKs here, where you can find all the details needed to customize your integration.


## What is the purpose of our SDKs?

We created these SDKs to help you enhance the security of your business and your customers without harming the user experience, even allowing you to customize the user experience by applying your brand's visual identity. Our SDKs are designed to abstract the complexity related to user device camera manipulation and image capture. In addition to other advantages:

#### Accuracy in capturing images
- Features that help the user to obtain biometrically valid photos, reducing the drop of images when compared to the capture performed by the devices' standard cameras. We've added SmartFrames, “key elements” that automatically adjust to the user's silhouette and aspect ratio allowing for better image capture.

#### Enhanced security​
- Encryption and security features against image injection, as well as features that prevent fraud adapted to our different flows, such as: Smartlive with interaction, smart camera, normal camera and document capture.
- Security layers that work in a complementary way, both at the application level and in relation to the data that travels between the SDKs and our backend.
- Code obfuscation, emulator blocking and bundle checking of the application running it.
